# datascience-project
Project for the data science course

# How to run

## install flask
pip install Flask

## installing the needed modules
pip install numpy pandas seaborn scipy matplotlib tensorflow joblib
pip install scikit-learn==1.3.0

the scikit-learn version used to train our model was 1.3.0, so the same version is needed in the environment running the app

## running the project
in the terminal from the project directory where app.py is located, run:
flask run

it will then be available on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in the browser
